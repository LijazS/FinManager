# FinAgent - AI-Powered Financial Assistant

An intelligent full-stack financial management platform that replaces traditional static expense forms with conversational AI [attached_image:1]. Built to showcase modern web development skills combining FastAPI backends, React frontends, LangGraph AI agents, and real-time data visualization [memory:7][memory:6].

## 🎯 Project Overview

FinAgent transforms expense tracking into natural conversations. Users chat with an AI agent that extracts financial data, stores transactions, generates personalized spending insights, and visualizes patterns through interactive dashboards [attached_image:1].

## 🚀 Technical Skills Demonstrated

### Backend Engineering
- **FastAPI Framework**: Built RESTful APIs with async request handling, Pydantic validation, and structured error responses [memory:7]
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Designed relational database schema for users, transactions, and expense categories with proper foreign key relationships [memory:6]
- **JWT Authentication**: Implemented secure user authentication with token-based access control [attached_image:3][attached_image:4]
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB integration for structured transaction data [memory:7]

### AI & Agent Engineering  
- **LangGraph Workflows**: Engineered stateful conversational agents that maintain context across multi-turn expense logging sessions [memory:11]
- **Tool Calling**: Implemented structured LLM function calling to parse natural language ("I spent $10 on coffee") into validated database transactions [memory:9]
- **Insight Generation**: Built AI-powered spending analysis that identifies patterns, unusual expenses, and budget recommendations [attached_image:1]
- **LLM Integration**: Connected Claude/OpenAI APIs with prompt engineering for financial data extraction and conversational responses [memory:10]

### Frontend Development
- **React + Vite**: Built responsive SPA with component-based architecture and React hooks for state management [memory:12][memory:13]
- **Tailwind CSS**: Designed modern dark-theme UI with utility-first styling for rapid development [memory:13][attached_image:1]
- **Real-time Visualization**: Integrated Recharts for interactive spending graphs and dashboard analytics [attached_image:1]
- **Form Handling**: Created authentication flows with controlled components and validation [attached_image:3][attached_image:4]

### DevOps & Deployment
- **Docker Containerization**: Containerized both frontend and backend services with multi-stage builds for production optimization [memory:5]
- **AWS Deployment**: Deployed application on AWS EC2 with proper networking and security group configuration [memory:5]
- **Environment Management**: Configured separate development and production environments with environment variables

## ✨ Key Features

- **Conversational Expense Logging**: Natural language input replaces manual forms - "I got tea for 15" automatically creates transactions [memory:9]
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Real-time spending analysis with personalized recommendations based on category patterns [attached_image:1]
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual spending breakdowns by category with daily/monthly/yearly views [attached_image:1]
- **Smart Categorization**: AI automatically categorizes expenses (Groceries, Food, Transport, Entertainment) [attached_image:1]
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication with protected routes [attached_image:3][attached_image:4]

## 📊 Dashboard Preview

The main dashboard displays:
- Real-time spending totals (Today/Month/Year) [attached_image:1]
- AI-generated spending insights with actionable recommendations [attached_image:1]  
- Budget suggestions based on spending patterns [attached_image:1]
- Conversational chat interface for logging new expenses [attached_image:1]
